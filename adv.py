Understand:
    Graph of 500 rooms
    Must visit every room at least once - in as few steps as possible
    Return a list of cardinal directions to walk through the graph

    You are starting in room 0 which the player has the ability to move n,e,s,w to connected rooms
        Move in one direction, record what room you are now in
            Move to rooms that room is connected to and record what is n s e and w of it
    Add all of this information in a dictionary as you traverse
        {room ID: {'n': ?, 's': ?, 'w': ?, 'e': ?}

    You should pick a direction, traverse depth first recording cardinal information
    Once you hit a room where every direction has been explored, 
        use BFS to find the closest unexplored exit (target of a direction with a ?)

    Output needs to be a list of steps taken
        Record the cardinal direction you moved to get from room to room, not the room ID's

    Move the player by player.travel('n')
        Will move the player north 1 room , if you can't go that way it will tell you
        Has attribute self.current_room

    Room class:
        get_room_in_direction() returns room object in that direction
        get_exits() returns list of cardinal directions you can move in from that room

Plan:
    Build out a dictionary with each room ID as a key and the value a dictionary of unknown n,e,s,w values
        As we traverse the graph we will update these values, and use the ? as indicators that direction hasn't been explored
            If we can't travel in a certain direction, overwrite the ? with a None
            Otherwise, overwrite the ? with the room ID as you move in that direction
                Or as you enter a room from that direction
    As you move, you need to update a few things:
        1. Add the cardinal direction you are moving to the traversal path list
            Every time you move even if you are just moving to the next unknown exit to explore
        2. Add the new room ID to the previous room's cardinal direction dictionary
            Only if the exit has not been explored before
        3. When you enter a room, replace any direction you can't move with None
            Add the information for the direction you just came in
